            <p>The EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism is entering a crucial new phase. Starting <strong>March 28, 2025</strong>, businesses importing regulated goods like aluminium, steel, iron, cement, fertilisers, electricity, and hydrogen must apply for Authorised CBAM Declarant status to continue operations seamlessly in the EU.</p>

            <p>This isn't just another checkbox in your compliance list—it's a significant hurdle that adds layers of administrative, financial, and risk assessment obligations. If you're not prepared, you could find yourself locked out of the EU market come January 1, 2026.</p>

            <p>Let's break down what you need to know and do.</p>

            <h2>Why Do You Need Authorised Declarant Status?</h2>

            <p>CBAM's goal is to prevent carbon leakage—ensuring that emissions-intensive production doesn't simply shift to regions with weaker environmental regulations. By requiring importers to hold Authorised CBAM Declarant status, the EU is making sure that only verified entities can manage CBAM certificate purchases, emissions reporting, and compliance monitoring.</p>

            <p>Without this status, you'll face import restrictions for covered goods. In other words, <strong>no authorization = no imports</strong>.</p>

            <h2>How to Become an Authorised CBAM Declarant</h2>

            <p>The application process has five key steps, outlined in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2025/486. Here's what you need to do:</p>

            <h2>Step 1: Submit Your Application</h2>

            <p>You'll need to apply electronically via the CBAM registry in the EU Member State where you're established. Your application must include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Company details (legal name, registered address)</li>
                <li>EORI number (Economic Operators Registration and Identification number)</li>
                <li>Estimated import volumes of CBAM-covered goods</li>
                <li>Proof of financial and operational capacity to comply with CBAM obligations</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you're not based in the EU, you'll need to submit your application through a representative authorized to act on your behalf within an EU Member State.</p>

            <h2>Step 2: Application Review and Additional Information Requests</h2>

            <p>Authorities will have up to <strong>120 days</strong> (or <strong>180 days</strong> for applications submitted before June 15, 2025) to review your submission.</p>

            <p>If they need more details, you may get an extension of up to 30 additional days to provide the information. During this period, you can also adjust submitted information if necessary, as long as you provide justification.</p>

            <h2>Step 3: Compliance Checks & Risk Assessment</h2>

            <p>This is where things get serious. You'll need to demonstrate:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Financial stability</strong> (no ongoing bankruptcy proceedings, ability to pay CBAM certificate costs)</li>
                <li><strong>Legal compliance</strong> (no history of serious or repeated tax/customs infringements)</li>
                <li><strong>Administrative capacity</strong> (sufficient internal controls to manage CBAM declarations)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>To prove these qualities, you'll need:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>An administrative organization that can fulfill the estimated obligations for CBAM certificates</li>
                <li>Internal controls that can prevent, detect, and correct errors in CBAM declarations</li>
                <li>Systems to identify and prevent illegal or irregular transactions</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You'll also need to establish key internal documents and processes, including:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Standard Operating Procedures</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Mechanisms to calculate and determine CBAM liability</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Clearly defined roles and responsibilities</strong> for managing CBAM declarations, certificate procurement, reporting, and supplier engagement</li>
                <li><strong>Internal controls</strong> to identify, manage, and mitigate incorrect, illegal, or irregular transactions</li>
            </ul>

            <p>For new businesses or those deemed high-risk, additional guarantees may be required.</p>

            <h2>Step 4: Decision and Authorisation</h2>

            <p>If approved, you'll receive a CBAM account number and be registered in the CBAM database. If rejected, you have the right to appeal.</p>

            <h2>Step 5: Ongoing Compliance & Monitoring</h2>

            <p>Getting authorized isn't the end—it's the beginning. Authorised CBAM Declarants must ensure continuous compliance with CBAM rules. EU authorities may reassess your authorization status at any time, and non-compliance or major infringements can result in revocation.</p>

            <h2>Key Deadlines You Can't Miss</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>March 28, 2025</strong> – CBAM Authorised Declarant applications open</li>
                <li><strong>June 15, 2025</strong> – Early application deadline for 180-day review period</li>
                <li><strong>January 1, 2026</strong> – Only Authorised CBAM Declarants can import regulated goods</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What Happens If Your Application Is Rejected?</h2>

            <p>If you're denied Authorised CBAM Declarant status, you have two options:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Appeal the decision</strong> and provide additional supporting documentation</li>
                <li><strong>Reapply</strong> with corrected or additional information</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Businesses without authorization by January 1, 2026, will be unable to import CBAM-covered goods into the EU. That's not a risk worth taking.</p>

            <h2>How to Prepare Now</h2>

            <p>To ensure a smooth application process, take these steps before March 28:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gather required documentation</strong> – Make sure company details, financial records, and emissions data are readily available</li>
                <li><strong>Assess compliance risk</strong> – Conduct an internal review to confirm financial stability and legal compliance history</li>
                <li><strong>Plan for potential guarantees</strong> – High-risk applicants may need to provide additional financial assurances</li>
                <li><strong>Engage with suppliers</strong> – Ensure upstream suppliers are providing accurate emissions data to avoid reporting risks</li>
                <li><strong>Monitor CBAM price dynamics</strong> – Since CBAM certificate costs are linked to the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), closely track ETS price trends</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Bottom Line: Act Now to Secure EU Market Access</h2>

            <p>The introduction of Authorised CBAM Declarant status marks a major shift in how businesses must manage carbon compliance. Companies that fail to act now risk losing access to EU markets when CBAM enforcement begins in 2026.</p>

            <p>By preparing applications early, ensuring internal compliance, and securing the necessary financial and administrative resources, you can protect your supply chains, mitigate risk, and stay competitive in a low-carbon economy.</p>
